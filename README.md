# Description of the project
## Objectives of the exercise
The objective is to develop a prototype messaging application.
The application will allow us to:
● See the discussions already opened
● Chat with a friend
● Create a new discussion.
Take example on facebook messenger.

## Planning
Do the exercise in a maximum of 8 hours. The goal is to do something functional, but you have to
keep in mind that it is a simple exercise, and the most important thing is to judge your ability to
manipulate react, and to produce a quality source code.

## Constraints

Technological constraints
Develop this application using react 18.x.x and hooks.
The goal is to test your react skills, so there is no need to waste time on server-side rendering.
You have the right to use the libraries of your choice.
To get started quickly you can for example use create-react-app
Data
To avoid wasting time, all data will be local, and there is no need for a webservice to interface with
the data.
It will still be a plus (if time permits), to manipulate this data asynchronously. To check if
asynchronous management is acquired.
Interface constraints
The goal is not to implement a design (html and css). You can therefore use any tool to facilitate the
prototyping of the application. (Tailwindcss, Bootstrap, material-ui etc...)

## Deployment and expected format
The result can be sent as an archive, or as a link to a repo git, containing all the necessary information
to compile and run the application.
The archive should contain, for example:
● The source files
● A README.md file explaining how to compile the sources and open the application
It is assumed that the application tester has nodesjs and npm (or yarn) on his computer.
